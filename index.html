      <p class="über_mich_text">Hello, I am Denis, <span id="age"></span> years old, live in Germany<span id="grade"></span>. Besides my
        enthusiasm for programming, I have other interesting skills and characteristics. I speak fluent German and
        sufficient English, which enables me to communicate with people from different countries and cultures. These
        language skills not only open up new opportunities for me in the field of programming, but also in the field of
        international cooperation and cultural exchange. Besides my passion for programming, I have other hobbies and
        interests. In my free time, I am in the youth fire brigade, the youth red cross and play handball. One of my
        strengths is the ability to recognize and solve problems. This applies not only to programming, but also to
        everyday life. I am a team player and find it fulfilling to find creative solutions in group projects and to
        achieve goals together. I am grateful for the many opportunities that programming offers me and I am determined
        to pursue my passion. I am curious about future projects and challenges and look forward to continuing to do my
        best to develop my skills as a programmer.</p>

        <img src="images/HTML-CSS-JS.png" alt="HTML, CSS, JS">
        <p>I have a solid understanding of HTML, JS, and CSS, and I have already successfully created websites. Although
          I have acquired a considerable amount of knowledge, I am always motivated to expand my skills and continue my
          personal growth. I am currently in a continuous learning process, aiming to deepen my abilities and explore
          new technologies. With my current knowledge, I am capable of designing creative and appealing websites,
          developing Discord bots, and writing scripts.</p>

    <h1 class="projects_title">My Projects</h1>
    <div class="project">
      <h2 class="project_title">Nature.net (April 2021 - March 2022) / McNature.de (December 2022 - May 2023)</h2>
      <p class="project_description">Nature.net was my first attempt at running a Minecraft server. Despite my enthusiasm for the game and my efforts to build a thriving community, I had to shut down the server due to my limited knowledge of server administration at the time.</p>
      <p class="project_description">However, the passion for the project never left me, so in 2022, I attempted a fresh start with the McNature.de server. Initially, things didn't go smoothly, and the server struggled to attract players. But when the SMP mode was introduced, everything changed. The server flourished and attracted a loyal player base of about 60 players.</p>
      <p class="project_description">Although the success was short-lived, and the player numbers dwindled over time, McNature.de was a valuable learning experience for me. Managing the server not only allowed me to acquire technical skills in server administration and plugin development but also improved important soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and community management.</p>
      <p class="project_description">Ultimately, I had to close the server in 2023 because I realized that my knowledge in Java programming and server administration wasn't sufficient to sustainably operate the server in the long run. Nevertheless, the time I spent with Nature.net and McNature.de was a valuable experience that greatly influenced my personal and professional development.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h2 class="project_title">Discord Bot (June 2023 - January 2024)</h2>
      <p class="project_description">My next major project was the development of a Discord bot. Initially, everything went smoothly, and I was excited about the opportunities it presented. My goal was to create a bot that stands out from others and offers many unique features.</p>
      <p class="project_description">I invested a lot of time and energy into perfecting my bot. I added numerous features, designed beautiful embeds and texts, integrated custom emojis, and even designed a banner for the bot. My ambitions knew no bounds, and I aimed to create the best Discord bot ever.</p>
      <p class="project_description">However, I encountered significant obstacles when developing the accompanying website for my bot. Creating an appealing and functional web panel was a challenge for which I was not adequately prepared. My lack of knowledge and experience in web development became evident to me as I attempted to tackle this task.</p>
      <p class="project_description">Despite my failure to successfully complete the project, working on my Discord bot was a valuable learning experience. I expanded my knowledge in bot programming, deepened my understanding of the Discord API, and further developed my design and creativity thinking. Even though the project didn't yield the results I had hoped for, it was an important step in my personal and professional development.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h2 class="project_title">Website Development (November 2023 - Now)</h2>
      <p class="project_description">My latest project involved the development of this website, Deniis.dev. It was a significant undertaking that allowed me to showcase my skills in web development and design.</p>
      <p class="project_description">The goal was to create a professional and visually appealing website that reflects my personality and showcases my portfolio and achievements. I invested a considerable amount of time and effort into designing the layout, choosing color schemes, and optimizing the user experience.</p>
      <p class="project_description">Throughout the development process, I faced various challenges, including implementing responsive design, optimizing site performance, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility. However, each challenge was an opportunity for growth, and I learned valuable lessons along the way.</p>
      <p class="project_description">Despite the occasional setbacks, completing this website was a fulfilling experience. It allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world project and provided me with a platform to showcase my work to the world.</p>
